* Overview

A systematic framework for inferring family relationships from fragmentary evidence, temporal correlation analysis, and probabilistic genealogical modeling.

** Project Status: Conceptual
This repository was created as the final punchline to a conversation about systematically turning every personal discovery into a technical infrastructure project. However, knowing the author, it will probably become a real thing eventually.

* Motivation

During investigation of [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/photographic-archaeology][photographic-archaeology]], it became clear that genealogical relationship inference requires its own systematic approach beyond temporal photo analysis.

** Core Problems
- Fragmentary family evidence requires probabilistic modeling
- Multiple evidence types need weighted correlation
- Relationship inference needs Bayesian updating
- Family tree reconstruction from partial data

* Theoretical Framework

** Evidence Types
- Photographic: Temporal analysis, relationship inference from poses/context
- Documentary: Birth certificates, marriage records, census data
- Biological: Age estimation, family resemblance analysis
- Cultural: Naming patterns, geographic clustering, cultural markers
- Technological: Analysis of artifacts, clothing, possessions

** Inference Pipeline
1. **Evidence Collection**: Multi-modal data gathering
2. **Temporal Correlation**: Establish chronological constraints
3. **Relationship Modeling**: Probabilistic family structure inference
4. **Bayesian Updating**: Incorporate new evidence iteratively
5. **Confidence Assessment**: Quantify relationship certainty

* Implementation Plan

** Phase 1: Evidence Framework
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Evidence:
    evidence_type: str
    relationship_hints: List[str] 
    temporal_constraints: DateRange
    confidence: float
    source: str

class RelationshipHypothesis:
    subject_a: Person
    subject_b: Person  
    relationship_type: str  # parent, grandparent, sibling, etc.
    probability: float
    supporting_evidence: List[Evidence]
#+END_SRC

** Phase 2: Inference Engine
- Constraint satisfaction for temporal consistency
- Probabilistic graphical models for family structures
- Bayesian networks for evidence integration
- Monte Carlo sampling for relationship exploration

** Phase 3: Integration
- Interface with photographic-archaeology results
- Import from genealogy databases (FamilySearch, Ancestry)
- Export to standard GEDCOM format
- Visualization of inferred family networks

* Usage Examples

** Basic Relationship Inference
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from genealogical_inference import InferenceEngine, Evidence

engine = InferenceEngine()

# Add photographic evidence
photo_evidence = Evidence(
    evidence_type="photographic",
    relationship_hints=["elderly_couple", "comfortable_posing"],
    temporal_constraints=DateRange(1985, 1995),
    confidence=0.8,
    source="mystery-family-roll-1"
)

# Add temporal evidence  
birth_evidence = Evidence(
    evidence_type="temporal",
    relationship_hints=["subject_born_2000"],
    temporal_constraints=DateRange(2000, 2000),
    confidence=1.0,
    source="known_birth_date"
)

engine.add_evidence([photo_evidence, birth_evidence])
relationships = engine.infer_relationships()

# Result: [(Person("subject"), Person("elderly_couple"), "great-grandparent", 0.73)]
#+END_SRC

** Family Tree Reconstruction
#+BEGIN_SRC python
family_tree = engine.reconstruct_family_tree(
    root_person="subject_born_2000",
    evidence_threshold=0.5
)

family_tree.visualize("results/inferred_family_structure.svg")
family_tree.export_gedcom("results/inferred_family.ged")
#+END_SRC

* Methodological Notes

** Confidence Calibration
- High (0.8-1.0): Multiple corroborating evidence types
- Medium-High (0.6-0.8): Strong single evidence source
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Circumstantial evidence patterns
- Low (0.2-0.4): Speculative inference

** Ethical Considerations
- Privacy preservation for living individuals
- Consent frameworks for family data usage
- Accuracy disclaimers for genealogical research
- Cultural sensitivity in relationship modeling

* Related Projects

- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/values-compass][values-compass]]: Personal values clarification system

Both demonstrate the systematic approach to turning personal discoveries into reproducible technical frameworks.

* Future Extensions

** Advanced Modeling
- Machine learning for relationship pattern recognition
- Natural language processing for historical document analysis
- Computer vision for family resemblance quantification
- Geographic clustering analysis for migration patterns

** Integration Capabilities
- APIs for major genealogy platforms
- Integration with DNA analysis services
- Historical records database connections
- Social network analysis tools

* Development

** Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/genealogical-inference-engine.git
cd genealogical-inference-engine
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

** Testing
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make test       # Run inference algorithm tests
make validate   # Validate against known family structures  
make benchmark  # Performance testing on large family trees
#+END_SRC

* Meta Commentary

This project represents the natural evolution of turning personal discoveries into systematic technical frameworks. What started as "who are these people in this photo?" becomes:

1. Photographic forensic analysis
2. Temporal correlation methodologies  
3. Privacy-preserving image processing
4. Genealogical inference engines
5. [Inevitable next framework TBD]

The author is constitutionally incapable of encountering an interesting problem without building comprehensive tooling to solve it systematically and reproducibly.
