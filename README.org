* Overview

A systematic framework for inferring family relationships from fragmentary evidence, temporal correlation analysis, and probabilistic genealogical modeling. This engine implements Bayesian inference methods to reconstruct family structures from multiple evidence sources.

* Motivation

During investigation of [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/photographic-archaeology][photographic-archaeology]], it became clear that genealogical relationship inference requires its own systematic approach beyond temporal photo analysis.

** Core Problems
- Fragmentary family evidence requires probabilistic modeling
- Multiple evidence types need weighted correlation
- Relationship inference needs Bayesian updating
- Family tree reconstruction from partial data

* Theoretical Framework

** Evidence Types
- Photographic: Temporal analysis, relationship inference from poses/context
- Documentary: Birth certificates, marriage records, census data
- Biological: Age estimation, family resemblance analysis
- Cultural: Naming patterns, geographic clustering, cultural markers
- Technological: Analysis of artifacts, clothing, possessions

** Inference Pipeline
1. *Evidence Collection*: Multi-modal data gathering
2. *Temporal Correlation*: Establish chronological constraints
3. *Relationship Modeling*: Probabilistic family structure inference
4. *Bayesian Updating*: Incorporate new evidence iteratively
5. *Confidence Assessment*: Quantify relationship certainty

* Implementation Plan

** Phase 1: Evidence Framework
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; Evidence record type
(define-record-type <evidence>
  (make-evidence type relationship-hints temporal-constraints confidence source)
  evidence?
  (type evidence-type)
  (relationship-hints evidence-relationship-hints)
  (temporal-constraints evidence-temporal-constraints)
  (confidence evidence-confidence)
  (source evidence-source))

;; Relationship hypothesis record
(define-record-type <relationship-hypothesis>
  (make-relationship-hypothesis subject-a subject-b type probability supporting-evidence)
  relationship-hypothesis?
  (subject-a relationship-hypothesis-subject-a)
  (subject-b relationship-hypothesis-subject-b)
  (type relationship-hypothesis-type)  ; 'parent, 'grandparent, 'sibling, etc.
  (probability relationship-hypothesis-probability)
  (supporting-evidence relationship-hypothesis-supporting-evidence))

** Phase 2: Inference Engine
- Constraint satisfaction for temporal consistency
- Probabilistic graphical models for family structures
- Bayesian networks for evidence integration
- Monte Carlo sampling for relationship exploration

** Phase 3: Integration
- Interface with photographic-archaeology results
- Import from genealogy databases (FamilySearch, Ancestry)
- Export to standard GEDCOM format
- Visualization of inferred family networks

* Usage Examples

** Basic Relationship Inference
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(use-modules (inference engine)
             (evidence types)
             (models person))

;; Create inference engine
(define engine (create-inference-engine))

;; Add photographic evidence
(define photo-evidence 
  (create-evidence 
   #:type 'photographic
   #:relationship-hints '("elderly_couple" "comfortable_posing")
   #:temporal-constraints (make-date-range 1985 1995)
   #:confidence 0.8
   #:source "mystery-family-roll-1"))

;; Add temporal evidence  
(define birth-evidence
  (create-evidence
   #:type 'temporal
   #:relationship-hints '("subject_born_2000")
   #:temporal-constraints (make-date-range 2000 2000)
   #:confidence 1.0
   #:source "known_birth_date"))

(add-evidence! engine (list photo-evidence birth-evidence))
(define relationships (infer-relationships engine))

;; Result: ((subject elderly-couple great-grandparent 0.73))
#+END_SRC

** Family Tree Reconstruction
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; Reconstruct family tree
(define family-tree 
  (reconstruct-family-tree engine "subject_born_2000" 0.5))

;; Visualize and export
(visualize-tree family-tree "results/inferred_family_structure.svg")
(export-gedcom family-tree "results/inferred_family.ged")
#+END_SRC

* Methodological Notes

** Confidence Calibration
- High (0.8-1.0): Multiple corroborating evidence types
- Medium-High (0.6-0.8): Strong single evidence source
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Circumstantial evidence patterns
- Low (0.2-0.4): Speculative inference

** Ethical Considerations
- Privacy preservation for living individuals
- Consent frameworks for family data usage
- Accuracy disclaimers for genealogical research
- Cultural sensitivity in relationship modeling
